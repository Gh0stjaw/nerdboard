As a developer the keyboard can be concidered your hammer. This is the hammer you want.

Ongoing project:
+ Custom split / attachable keyboard
+ Custom printed casing
+ Handmade soldering and customizations.

Full blown layered keys (36-46) with x layers (depends on your need).
Easy configurable layers to fit any use patterns.

-- TODO: Toolchain, progress, process, fw and sw.
